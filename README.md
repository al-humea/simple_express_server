# Simple Express Server 🚀

## What is it? 🤔
Hello there! This is my personal project, a Simple Express Server. It's a small server I built to get hands-on experience with Express.js. It's a simple, yet effective way to learn and understand server-side development.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **JavaScript**: Powering the server-side logic.
- **HTML**: For the basic front-end.

## Structure 🗂️
- `node_modules/`: Necessary Node.js modules.
- `public/`: Static files live here.
- `router/`: Manages the routing.
- `404.html`: Custom page for 404 errors.
- `database.js`: Handles database interactions.
- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `index.js`: The core server file.
- `logged.html`: Shown after logging in.
- `package*.json`: Lists project dependencies.

## How to Run 🚀
1. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/al-humea/simple_express_server.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: In the project directory, run `npm install`.
3. **Fire up the server**: Execute `node index.js` and you're good to go!

## Note 📝
This is a personal project created for learning purposes. It's complete in its current form, and I'm not seeking contributions. No license is needed as this is just a part of my learning journey.

Enjoy exploring! 🎉
